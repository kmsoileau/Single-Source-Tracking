\f0\fs48 \cf0 After I left Duke, I joined Mamere, Julie and Tante Maude at Bon Repos, our family house on Lake Ponchartrain. After the rather uncomfortable revelation that I had flunked out of Duke, Mamere and Julie invited me to join them on Fig Street. I moved into Papere\'92s bedroom in the rear of the apartment, and shifted the bed over near the windows in the corner. I bought a mobile and hung it over the bed. The room also had an armoire, a dresser, a chair and a desk. Perfect for me at the time. I soon found a job at Amoco Production Company marking well logs used by petroleum engineers to locate oil and natural gas deposits.\
Mamere and Julie asked me to contribute $40 a week for my board, a good deal.}
